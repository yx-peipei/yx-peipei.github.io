When I originally built up this blog, I was intended to record my life; however, when I looked back after three years, I find my blog turns out to be personal diary, sharing what I read and what is flowing inside my mind. A bit metaphysical, too much spiritual puzzles. However, I am not that sentimentalism as you imagine, not the same as a philosophy fellow who only cares about the conceptual world; in the real world, I spent almost two hours every day to keep fit, by sport and by healthy eating.

Healthy diet is no doubt the most important part for keeping fit, I am a great advocate for a natural diet. I am not interested in any fancy diet plan such as low-carb or low-fat or keto, I believe most of those research articles are not rigorous enough ; instead, I am more focused on the natural flavours of food: less salty dish with as less processed ingredient as possible. Perhaps I am too prickly on what I want to eat, my daily calorie intake is usually im deficit, but I would like to say, eat natural, eat simple and do not pay too much attention to the diet.

When it comes to the workouts, I have more tips to share.  I have been member of the luxury gym Third Space for more than three years. The membership fee is very pricy, almost all my friends cancelled their membership due to the cost, but I keep it until now,  partly because I go to gym almost everyday, which makes each single entrance seemed  less expensive, partly because the classes are really of haut-standard. As evidence, one of my main consumption principles is if I really need something, I would go for the best and most expensive choice. I usually attend the lunchtime classes of HIIT style, submerging myself in the following ones: Extreme, SweatX, Metaburn and Spinning. Each class is 45-min workouts including warm-up and stretches.

'Extreme' has four rounds of eight minutes HIIT workout, each eight minutes has four 30-second exercices four times: exercise I and III are more like body-weight strength such as langes, plank with shoulder tap, step pull-ups whilst exercise II and IV are mainly designed to boost heart rate: jumping-langes, step tap traverse, burpees and frog-jumps.  Instrument-wise, a step is the only must. My takeaway from this class is: **If people jumps all the time, it won't make them very sweaty, if people keep doing strength, they won't feel hot neither.  A combination of jumping and strength can make people feel tired and sweaty quite soon**, and those classes will gain a better reputation for 'fat burning'. Really fat-burning? Who knows.

SweatX is another calorie-killer in Third Space. This class is equipped with  more fancy stuffs: a headset, as we need the instructions from the trainer when we are sprinting on the treadmill. In addition, the coach will prepare us with a set of heavy weights, usually two 6s/8s/10s. The training is composed with 2 rounds of running and 2 rounds of floor weight exercises, each of them lasts 8 minutes. First round of running goes for high gradient: it usually begins with 8/10/12 km/h with 2% gradient, then top up gradually to 8/10% with the same speed; once peaked, we will release the tensions on the leg  by a gradual decrease of 2% every minute,  but an increase of 2km/h in the speed for compensation. It is not that hard as it looked like, because we usually have a 30-second rest in the middle of this round. Second round of running is mainly for speed. Keeping the gradient as 0.5% but the coach gradually runs me into 15/16 km/h. Of course for those harder-core friends, they can reach up to 20km/h for one minute. Sometimes the coach would ask us to set a target, say running 160m in the maximum speed in 40s, then rest for 20 second, then go for that target again, that 20s' rest is a must, which means the 40s' work requires us a train-catching rocket speed.  Floor round is for dumbbell strength training. Sally, one of the main coach, likes to design the class with bundles of snatch with dumbbells, deadlift, shoulder press, push-up with windmill or with dumbbell row, lunges, arm rows. Usually we have four to six exercise to finish; for the first turn, each exercise requires 12 repetition; second turn, 9 reps; third turn, 6 then finish with 3 reps each exercise. Once finished, we are allowed to rest until the next running session. After 45 minutes, I am liked to be soaked in the water, even I haven't seen a person who has less sweat as myself. In a word, the way SweatX makes us sweat, is again as what I described above: **a mixture of cardio and strength**. During the strength exercises, once  the heart rate begins to decline, we add some half-burpees; during the running, once the body is accustomed to one speed, we would hear a 'lovely' lady voice from the headset: increase your speed/gradient by 2.

I am not a sport expert, neither did I spend a lot of time in optimizing my workout routine, but this method does work for me.  A fitter body is the evidence. And  I see so many grils around me get belly fat that easily after leaving school and beginning 9-5 style job; I see how easily people become lazy and become accustomed in the daily routine. Fearful, they do not realize the laziness. For workout, and for life as well, we need prompt changes and make us an irregular routine. Memory in the mind is good, it will protect us from making the same mistake and save time; memory in the body is not that good in some sense, it will minimize our energy consumption, make us lazy.

At the beginning of locking down, I usually did the 6km morning run every two days; but now, only twice a week. Of course there are excuses such as  the train schedule is reduced so much that I cannot easily return home after running to West Hampstead; but the depper reason is I find it more convenient to follow the so-called youtube workout and tick the box that I have done a daily exercise . To be honest, even though I keep doing a lot high-intensity workout from Devil Pamela or Keep, it still fails to achieve the same benefits of running outdoor for 40 minutes. Fresh air, the first sunshine in the morning, the up-and-downs on the road, the very attention on running and breathing, will reset my mind, release my tension, throw the tiny troubles away from my body. I think, this is the true purpose of keep exercices in a daily basis, not the number on the weight balance.
 
Last part: it is a popular HIIT from China Hupu that I find worthy trying. For the english translation it is:
