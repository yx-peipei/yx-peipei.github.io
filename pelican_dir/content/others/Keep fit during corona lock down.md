When I originally built up this blog, I was intended to record my life; however, when I revise this blog after three years, I find it turns out to be a personal diary, sharing what I read and what is flowing inside my mind. A bit metaphysical, too much spiritual puzzles. However, I am not that sentimentalism as you might imagine, neither the same as a philosophy fellow who only cares about the conceptual world; in everyday life, I spend almost two hours a day to keep fit, by sport and by healthy eating.

Healthy diet is no doubt the most important part for keeping fit, I am a great advocate for a natural diet. I am not interested in any fancy diet plan such as low-carb or low-fat or keto, I believe most of those research articles are not rigorous enough ; instead, I am more focused on the natural flavours of food: less salty dish with as less processed ingredients as possible. Perhaps I am too prickly on what I choose to eat, my daily calorie intake is usually in deficit, but I would like to say: eat natural, eat simple and do not pay too much attention to the diet. 

When it comes to the workouts, I have more tips to share.  I have been the member of a luxury gym (Third Space) for more than three years. The membership fee is very pricy, almost all my friends cancelled their memberships due to the cost, but I keep it until now,  partly because I go to gym almost everyday, which makes each single entrance seemed  less expensive, partly because the classes are really  'haute de gamme'. Incidentally, one of my main  principles regarding to the consumption is,  if I really need something, I would go for the best thus usually most expensive choice. Coming back to the classes in this gym: I often attend the lunchtime classes of HIIT style, submerging myself in the following choices: Extreme, SweatX, Metaburn and Spinning. Each class is a 45-min workout including warm-up and stretches, guided by the coach.

'Extreme' has four rounds of eight minutes HIIT workout, each eight-minute has four 30-second exercises four times: exercise I and III are more like body-weight strength,  typical examples are langes, plank with shoulder tap, step push-ups;  whilst exercise II and IV are mainly designed to boost the heart rates: jumping-langes, step tap traverse, burpees and frog-jumps.  Instrument-wise, a step is the only requirement. My takeaway from this class is: **If people jump all the time, it won't make them very sweaty, if people keep doing strength, they won't feel hot neither.  A combination of jumping and strength can make people feel tired and sweaty quite soon**, and those classes will gain a  reputation for 'effective fat burning'. People believe the sweat is the tear of fat. Really fat-burning? Who knows. 

'SweatX' is another calorie-killer in Third Space. This class is equipped with a more fancy stuff: a headset, because we need onlive instructions from the trainer when sprinting on the treadmill. In addition, the coach will prepare us with a set of heavy weights, usually two 6s/8s/10s kg. The training is composed with 2 rounds of running and 2 rounds of floor weight trainning, each of them lasts 8 minutes. First round of running goes for high gradient: it usually begins with 8/10/12 km/h with 2% grade, then top up gradually to 8/10% with the same speed; once peaked, we will release the tensions on the leg  by a gradual decrease of 2% every minute,  but an increase of 2km/h in the speed for compensation. It is not that hard as it looked like, because we usually have a 30-sec rest in the middle of this round. Second round of running is mainly for a faster speed. Keeping the grade as 0.5% but the coach gradually asks us to run into 15/16 kph. Of course for those harder-core friends, they can reach up to 20kph and keep it for one minute. Sometimes the coach would ask us to set a distance target, say run for 160 meters with the maximum speed in 40s, then rest for 20s, then repete them for 5 times. That 20s' rest is a must, which means the 40s' work requires us a speed as if we are catching the train.  Floor round is for dumbbell strength training. Sally, one of the main coach, likes to design this section with bundles of snatch with dumbbells, deadlift, shoulder press, push-up with windmill or with dumbbell row, lunges, arm rows, burpees, butterfy sit up, etc. Usually we have four to six exercises each round; for the first turn, each exercise requires 12 repetition; second turn, 9 reps; third turn, 6 then finish with 3 reps. Once finished, we are allowed to take a small rest until the next running session. After 45 minutes, we are all liked to be soaked in the water. In a word, the way SweatX makes us sweat, is again as what I described above: **a mixture of cardio and strength**. During the strength exercises, once  the heart rate begins to decline, we add some half-burpees; during the running, once the body is accustomed to one speed, we would hear a 'lovely' lady voice from the headset: increase your speed/gradient by 2.

I am not a sport expert, neither did I spend a lot of time in optimizing my workout routine, but this method does work for me.  My fitter body is the evidence. In the past few years,  I see so many grils around me get belly fat that easily after leaving school and beginning 9-5 style job; I see how easily people become lazy and become accustomed in the daily routine. More fearful, they do not realize their laziness. For the workout, and even for the life, we need prompt changes, we need  to design them for an irregular routine. Memory in the mind may be good, it will protect us from making the same mistake and save time (as machine learning principles); memory in the body is not that good in most cases, it will minimize our energy consumption, make us lazy.

At the beginning of lockdown, I usually did the 6km morning run every two days; but now, only twice a week. Of course there are excuses such as  the train schedule is reduced so much that I cannot easily return home after running to West Hampstead; but a deeper reason is I find it more convenient to follow the so-called youtube workout , satisfy myself that I have done that daily exercises, I tick the To-Do box . To be honest, even though I keep doing a lot high-intensity workout from Devil Pamela or Keep, it still fails to  achieve the same benefits of running outdoor for 40 minutes. Fresh air, the first sunshine in the morning, the up-and-downs on the road, the very attention on breathing, those things will reset my mind, release my tension, throw those tiny troubles away from my body. I think, it is  the true purpose of keep moving. Keeping fit is not just keeping the body fit, neither  keeping the  number on the weight balance nioce, it is also keeping the mind fit and positive.
